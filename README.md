# Enhancing automated trading systems knowledge discovery through a novel fusion framework in predicting stocks explainable turning points
## Overview

This repository implements an advanced trading system designed to address the fundamental challenge of "Buy Low, Sell High" in stock market trading. By fusing investor trading principles with adaptive feature engineering, the system provides timely, reliable, and substantially profitable Entry/Exit signals.

**Key Innovation**: Information fusion framework combining TPL and MSFE for enhanced trading knowledge discovery - a unique approach not previously explored in existing literature.

## Key Features

- 📊 **Turning Points Labeling (TPL)**: Novel labeling based on actual investor trading principles
- 🔧 **Multi-stage Self-adaptive Feature Engineering (MSFE)**: Advanced feature discovery pipeline
- 🤖 **Model-Agnostic**: Works with tree-based, linear, instance-based, and neural network models
- 🔍 **Explainable AI Platform**: Regime-aware feature importance and actionable insights
- 📈 **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated on 30 NYSE100 stocks from 2012-2023
- 💰 **Two-Sided Trading**: Greedy Long/Short strategy maximizing both buy and sell opportunities
